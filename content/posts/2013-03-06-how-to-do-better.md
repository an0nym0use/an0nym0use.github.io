title: How to do the same thing, but better

Most of the things we do, we only do for part of our lives.

We work for 8 hours a day (minimum), we spend time on our hobbies, we do our washing and clean our homes. Most of us feel that there aren’t enough hours in the day to do everything. I feel that. And when I don’t feel that, I don’t feel like maximising my use of the time that there is.

My world is full of things that pull me off course. The movies-to-watch list that gets updated much too regularly, the steam account with half a dozen new indie games every other week, the-social-network-that-must-not-be-named. I often don’t have the energy to truly LIVE every day.

Some research has suggested that we only have so much energy to make decisions in a day. The percentage of favourable rulings that Judges make can drop significantly based on when in they decide during the day. This means that if we spend all our time wondering how to say something to that cute girl online, or what shoes to wear, we are negatively impacting our decision-making skills for the more important tasks in the day (although, it depends how cute she is).

It is for this reason that I am implementing a three step plan into my life to attempt to make better decisions.

* Step One: Wardrobe. I have replaced all my tops with a pile of plain white tee-shirts, and plain charcoal running tops. Next phase of this is to replace my pants with only one colour/style, but maybe next week. No decision-energy wasted on unimportant clothing choices - check.
* Step Two: Nutrition. I am shopping twice a week and buying very specific items to fill my fridge. The most notable part of this is the lack of carbs. No potatoes, pasta, beans, bread etc. Cheat day is Saturday, pencil it into your calendars. The other half of this is the very controlled consumption of alcohol. Stable blood sugar levels with moderate(?) bingeing, more consistent concentration throughout the day - check.
* Step Three: Exercise. 30 minutes per day. No excuses. A steady progression of resistance training with lashings of cardio. No all-nighters and better blood circulation, helping the brain - check.
It’s only day two for me, if I fail, I will post about it.

Ciao.
